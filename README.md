Technology Stack
The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern full-stack technology stack to build a scalable, secure, and feature-rich booking platform. Below is an overview of the technologies used and their purpose in the project:

Backend & Frameworks
-Django: A high-level Python web framework used to build the server-side logic, manage database interactions, handle routing, and implement authentication and authorization.  
-Django REST Framework (DRF): Extends Django to create RESTful APIs for CRUD operations, filtering, searching, and user interactions.  

Database
-PostgreSQL/MySQL: A robust relational database system used to store structured data such as Users, Listings, Bookings, Reviews, and Amenities. Supports complex queries, indexing, and scalability.  
-SQLite (optional for development): Lightweight database used during development and testing phases.  

Frontend
-Django Templates: Used to render dynamic HTML pages with data from the backend.  
-Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS: CSS frameworks used to design responsive and visually appealing layouts.  
-JavaScript: Provides interactivity on the frontend, including dynamic booking forms, modals, and AJAX requests for smoother UX.  

APIs & Communication
-RESTful APIs: Serve as the communication layer between the frontend and backend, enabling data retrieval and manipulation.  
-AJAX: Facilitates asynchronous requests, allowing parts of pages to update without a full reload.  

Authentication & Security
-Django Authentication System: Handles user registration, login, logout, and password management.  
-JWT / Token Authentication: Secures API endpoints by restricting access based on user roles.  
-CSRF Protection: Safeguards against cross-site request forgery attacks.  

DevOps & Deployment 
-Docker: Containerizes the application for consistent deployment across environments.  
-Heroku / AWS / DigitalOcean: Cloud platforms to host the web application and database.  
-Git & GitHub: Version control system for collaborative development and code management.  

Additional Tools
-Pillow: Python imaging library used for image uploads and processing (e.g., listing photos).  
-Celery / Redis: Handles asynchronous tasks like sending booking confirmation emails or notifications.

API Security
Securing the backend APIs is a critical aspect of the Airbnb Clone Project to protect sensitive user data, booking information, and payment transactions. Below are the key security measures implemented in the project:

1. Authentication
  -Implementation: Uses Django’s built-in authentication system with username/email and password, extended with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for API endpoints.  
  -Purpose: Ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints.  
  -Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts, bookings, and personal data.

2. Authorization
  -Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types such as Guest, Host, and Admin. Permissions are enforced on API endpoints to restrict actions.  
  -Purpose: Ensures that users can only perform actions allowed for their role.  
  -Importance: Protects sensitive operations, e.g., only hosts can edit their property listings, and only guests can book properties.

3. Data Validation & Input Sanitization
  -Implementation: All incoming data is validated using Django forms or DRF serializers. Inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks.  
  -Purpose: Ensures data integrity and security.  
  -Importance: Prevents malicious users from injecting harmful data that could compromise the application or database.

4. CSRF Protection
  -Implementation: Enabled for all forms and sensitive API requests.  
  -Purpose: Protects against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks, where malicious sites attempt to perform actions on behalf of authenticated users.  
  -Importance: Safeguards user sessions and prevents unauthorized bookings or data changes.

5. HTTPS & Secure Communication
  -Implementation: Application is deployed over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit between clients and server.  
  -Purpose: Prevents interception of sensitive information, such as passwords and payment details.  
  -Importance: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of user and payment data.

6. Rate Limiting & Throttling
  - Implementation: APIs are protected with request limits per user/IP to prevent abuse and brute-for
